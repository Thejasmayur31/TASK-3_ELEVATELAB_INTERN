# TASK-3_ELEVATELAB_INTERN
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python’s scikit-learn library. Two real-world datasets are used:

House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression to predict price based on area (sqft).

Airbnb Rental Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression, where multiple features like location, room type, and minimum nights are used to estimate listing prices.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, train-test splitting, model training, evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score, and visualizing predictions using matplotlib. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts continuous values and understand the importance of each feature in the prediction.
